* The project was shared with family and friend to be tested on different devises as well as to collect data 
about their actual user experience. There was a positive feedback and conformation for the user experience testing above.


### Code Testing

All four pages of code were runned in W3C Markup Validator for HTML and W3C CSS Validator for CSS validators.  

- The HTML code was tested [here!](https://validator.w3.org/)
- The CSS code was tested [here!](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

No issues or errors were shown. The testing of the code was done by direct input method.

### Device Testing

The project was tested on various devices to search for any problems with responsiveness 
and how it is visually presented on different screen sizes.

Devices tested:

### Problems

When testing the responsiveness there was an issue found with the heading standing on the hero image in the home page.
The problem is on devices with screen width under 300px. The heading is going down and covers the text bellow the image.
Could't make it to remain on the hero image as intended.
